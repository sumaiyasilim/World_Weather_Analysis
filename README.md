# World_Weather_Analysis

The purpose of this assignment is to allow users to be able to input statements into the app to allow them to filter the data for their weather preferences, which can then be used to identify a potential travel destinaton and the hotels in the area. Once the user chooses a potential travel destination, they will then choose four cities to create a travel itenirary from. Then by using Google Maps Directions API, we will be able to create a travel route between the four cities, as well as a marker map, for the user to use in their travels.
